Q2. the comand does not work as intended becuase there was no docs derectory to save it to so it just created a file called a copy of file1.txt called docs
Q3. there is no file called file1.txt because we renamed it to file3.txt
Q4. the comand does not work because there are files in the directory we are trying to delete and they have to be deleted before the directory can be deleted
